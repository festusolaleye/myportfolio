								<p>The shark attack dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of shark encounters over the last century, covering attack locations, victim demographics, and involved shark species. 
									Data complexities were managed through adept data cleaning and transformation skills, allowing for a thorough analysis of shark attack trends.</p>
								<p>Key insights reveal that 2,429 shark attacks occurred globally, resulting in 415 fatalities. Unprovoked incidents were predominant, while attacks related to boating activities were less frequent. 
									The year 2015 recorded the highest number of shark attacks, indicating potential environmental or behavioral factors.</p>
								<p>Recommendations: Comprehensive public awareness campaigns should be put in place to educate communities living in coastal regions and engaging in water activities about shark safety measures. 
									These campaigns should emphasize understanding shark behavior, avoiding risky behavior and implementing appropriate precautions while in the water.</p>

								<p>The project analyzes US birth data from 2016 to 2021, focusing on factors like birth rates, gender, birth weight, and maternal education levels. Sourced from the CDC, the dataset offers insights into birth trends across different educational backgrounds and regions. 
									After cleaning and refining the data, statistical analysis and visualization were employed to reveal trends.
								</p>
								<p>Key findings from the analysis cover all 50 states and the District of Columbia, showing a total of 22,618,480 births recorded over the six-year period. Males outnumbered females in births, and California had the highest number of recorded births, indicating potential population density impacts. 
									Michigan had the lowest number among the top 10 states, showcasing regional birth rate variations.</p>
								<p>The recommendation suggests governmental efforts to improve maternal health literacy and access to prenatal care services nationwide. This aims to optimize birth outcomes and reduce disparities in birth rates and birth weight across different states. 
									Such initiatives would target enhancing maternal health education and healthcare access to promote healthier outcomes for mothers and infants throughout the country.</p>

								"target="_blank" class="image featured"><img src="images/Student Mental Health.PNG" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The project investigates the correlation between mental health and students' Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) using data from a survey by Quantum Analytics NG via Google Forms. 
									Data cleaning and transformation ensured accuracy before analysis. Insights from 101 university student responses show an average age of 20 years, indicating a traditional college-aged sample. The dataset covers 48 courses, reflecting the diversity of academic pursuits.</p>
								<p>Significant observations include a concentration of high academic achievers, with 48 out of 101 students having a CGPA falling within the range of 3.50 to 4.00. However, concerning mental health, only 6 out of 101 students actively seek treatment, while the majority (95 students) do not seek any treatment. 
									This highlights potential disparities in access to mental health resources among students, underscoring the necessity for greater support services on college campuses. </p>
								<p>Recommendation <br>
									The University should consider implementing targeted mental health support programs within universities to encourage students to seek treatment and improve access to resources, ultimately fostering a supportive environment conducive to academic success.</p>

								<p>The Stockholm cholera outbreak dashboard provides a comprehensive summary of the epidemic, covering key details like location, victim demographics, and occupational backgrounds. 
									Successful data cleaning and transformation were crucial for handling the initially challenging data from Quantum Analytics NG before visualizing it using Tableau.</p>
								<p>Insights from the dashboard highlight significant patterns: the average age of victims is 34 years, with 248 reported deaths, evenly distributed between genders. The occupations most affected include Mamsell, Gossebarn, Flickebarn, Arbetskari, and Anka, indicating vulnerability across diverse job sectors. 
									The age group of 30 to 49 faced the highest mortality, while those aged 70 to 90 showed lower vulnerability.</p>
								<p>Recommendations based on these insights suggest initiating public awareness campaigns, especially in high-risk areas, to promote safer practices during water activities. 
									These efforts aim to reduce risks and enhance community safety in the face of the cholera outbreak.</p>
