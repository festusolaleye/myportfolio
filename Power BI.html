								<p>This Bitcoin project analyzes historical market data from January 2012 to March 2021, focusing on minute-by-minute updates from select exchanges. Data cleaning and transformation ensured accuracy, addressing missing or erroneous entries. 
									The analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns in Bitcoin market activity.</p>
								<p>Key Insights: <br> Bitcoin's volume is 33.69 million, with a currency volume of 150.92 billion. The average weighted price is $4.47k. There's a progressive price trend in 2021, but it has the lowest BTC volume, indicating potentially lower trading activity. 
									However, 2021 records the highest currency volume, signifying increased market participation.</p>
								<p>Recommendation <br>
									There should be monitoring and addressing of any potential market volatility or fluctuations in currency volume to maintain stability and investor confidence in Bitcoin transactions.
